# Vegetable Classifier
In this project, I built an effective image classifier for the most common vegetables found across the globe. For image
        classification, I employed the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in tandem with a few popular preprocessing
        steps. This project was purely meant as a learning experience so there is no defining problem statement to support this
        project. Instead, my goal was to tune and improve my model to maximize performance. The final iteration achieved a
        training accuracy of 96.73%.
